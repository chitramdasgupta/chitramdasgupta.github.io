## Introduction

I have been a Windows-only user since I first used a computer way back in 2007. For a long time, I assumed Windows and Mac os were the only Operating systems that people used.

Linux, to me, was something used only on supercomputers and large servers. That began to change as I started studying engineering. I learned programming and eventually discovered open-source software and the philosophy behind it. YouTube creators like DistroTube finally convinced me to give Linux a try.

I have been using Manjaro Xfce for 14 days now and in this post, I want to share my thoughts.

## Managing software with package manager

The first thing I loved about Linux was managing software with a package manager. On Windows, I usually downloaded installers from websites and then had to update each app manually. With pacman (the package manager for Arch-based distros), I can install almost all of my favorite software and update the entire system right from the terminal.

Since Manjaro is based on Arch Linux, I also get access to the vast AUR (Arch User Repository). I installed yay, an AUR helper, to make installing packages from the AUR easy.

## The terminal rocks

In Linux, the terminal feels natural—especially with all the GNU utilities.

The terminal is highly customizable; I used Starship to tweak my prompt. With the terminal and shell commands at my fingertips, I feel like I’m in the driver’s seat of my computer.

## Freedom of choice

Linux is all about freedom and choice. Right from the start, you can choose a distribution with a release model that suits you: fixed release (Debian, Ubuntu), strict rolling release (Arch, EndeavourOS), or slightly delayed rolling release (Manjaro). Then there’s the choice of desktop environment (GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce) or even a window manager (i3, awesome).

Thanks to a huge number of open-source developers, there’s a plethora of software to pick from. The freedom Linux offers is unparalleled. Something exciting is always happening in the FOSS community.

## Manual, wiki, forums and docs

Let me begin by saying that the ArchWiki rules! It’s incredibly useful for Arch-based distros.

Ask Ubuntu is also helpful, and the Manjaro Forum is especially useful for update information. However, I think the Manjaro Wiki could use some work and isn’t very comprehensive (especially compared to the behemoth that is the ArchWiki).

Linux is helping me build the habit of reading manual pages and documentation. The man pages have been invaluable for understanding what a particular command does.

I would advise new linux users to get in the habit of reading man pages, documentation, and of scouring forums and wiki.

## Faster and smoother computing experience

One thing I noticed immediately after installing Manjaro is that my laptop became faster and much smoother. On a cold boot, htop shows that I am using only about 600-700 MB of RAM (This figure might differ depending on the DE or WM). Programs like Firefox start faster and compilation speed of programs is also noticeably better.

## Cons of linux

Honestly, I haven’t run into anything I’d call a negative. Before installing, I browsed the internet reading about the problems many users faced with their hardware after switching to a Linux distro. Fortunately, I haven’t had any problems—everything works fine on my laptop.

## Ending note

These last few days have been an absolute joy. I feel like I truly own my device and I can use it to it’s full potential.

Next, I plan to try the i3 window manager, keep learning Bash scripting, and take a deep dive into how the Linux kernel works—maybe even write some system software. The possibilities feel endless now!
