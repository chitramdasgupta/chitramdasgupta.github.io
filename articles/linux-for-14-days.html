<h1>Thoughts After Using Linux For 14 Days</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I have been a Windows-only user since the very first time I used a computer back in 2007. For a long time I felt that Windows and Mac os were the only Operating system that everybody used.</p>
<p>Linux, for me, was something used only in supercomputers and huge servers. But that idea started to change as I began studying engineering. I learnt programming and eventually came across open source software and the morale behind it. Youtube content creators like DistroTube finally convinced me to give Linux a try.</p>
<p>I have been using Manjaro Xfce for 14 days now and in this post, I plan to share my thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="managing-software-with-package-manager">Managing software with package manager</h2>
<p>The first thing I liked about linux was the concept of managing software using a package manager. In windows, I had to download and install software from a website and then manually update it for the most part. But with pacman( package manager for Arch-based distros) I can install almost any of my favourite software and update the entire system the terminal itself.</p>
<p>Since Manjaro is based on Arch linux, I also get access to the vast AUR(Arch User Repository). I installed an AUR helper <em>yay</em> to easily install packages from the AUR.</p>
<h2 id="the-terminal-rocks">The terminal rocks</h2>
<p>In linux, the terminal just <em>feels</em> natural to use with all the GNU utils.</p>
<p>The terminal is infinitely customizable and I used <em>starship</em> to customize the prompt. With the terminal and the Shell commands at my hands, I feel like I am at the driving seat of my computer.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-of-choice">Freedom of choice</h2>
<p>Linux is all about freedom and choice. Right from the start, there is a choice of distribution with different release models like static release(Debian, Ubuntu, etc), strictly rolling release(Arch, Endeavouros, etc) and a slighly delayed rolling release(Manjaro, etc). Then comes the choice of DE like GNOME, KDE, Xfce, etc or even WM like i3, awesome, etc.</p>
<p>With a huge number of open source developers, there’s a plethora of software choices. The freedom of choices linux offers is unparalleled. Something exciting is always happening in the FOSS community.</p>
<h2 id="manual-wiki-forums-and-docs">Manual, wiki, forums and docs</h2>
<p>Let me begin by saying that the ArchWiki rules! It is very useful to look up queries for arch-based distros.</p>
<p>askubuntu is also helpful. Moreover, the Manjaro forum is also very helpful especially regrading updates. However, I think that the Manjaro wiki needs a bit of a work and is not very rich (especially compared to the behemoth that is ArchWiki).</p>
<p>Linux is helping me develop the habit of reading manual pages and documentation. The man pages helped me a lot about understanding what a particular command does.</p>
<p>I would advise new linux users to get in the habit of reading man pages, documentation and also scouring the forums and wiki.</p>
<h2 id="faster-and-smoother-computing-experience">Faster and smoother computing experience</h2>
<p>One thing I noticed immediately after installing Manjaro is that my laptop became faster and much smoother. On a cold boot, <code>htop</code> shows that I am using only about 600-700 MB of RAM (This figure might differ depending on the DE or WM). Programs like Firefox start up faster and compilation speed of programs is also much better.</p>
<h2 id="cons-of-linux">Cons of linux</h2>
<p>Honestly, I have faced nothing that counts as a negative. Before installing, I was browsing through the internet reading through the problems many users faced with their hardware after installing a linux distro. But fortunately,I have not had any problem, everything works fine on my laptop.</p>
<h2 id="ending-note">Ending note</h2>
<p>These last few days have been an absolute joy. I feel like I truly own my device and I can use it to it’s full potential.</p>
<p>I plan on trying out the i3 window manager next, continue learning bash scripting and taking a deep dive into how the linux kernel works and maybe even write system software. Possibilities seem to be endless now!</p>
