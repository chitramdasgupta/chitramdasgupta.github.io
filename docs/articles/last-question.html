<h1 class="title">Asimov’s Last Question</h1>
<p class="date">16 June 2022</p>

<h1 id="each-human-being-is-special">Each human being is special</h1>
<p>Each human being is special in that they add to the knowledge
repository of the universal AC. So, each life decisions and events
howsoever unique or different is important. We need to accumulate more
and more knowledge from human beings to enrich the universal knowledge
store. If the universal AC is considered to be God, it is in God’s
service to live our lives to the fullest and follow our dreams even if
we are very different from the ones who have already worked towards our
dream.</p>
<p>The most fulfilling life hence becomes the one which makes the most
out of our limited lifespan and experience the most novel experiences.
Also we should do something different in a less explored domain or do
excellent in an already existing one. We might also present the existing
knowledge in a new and novel way. All in all, we need to get out and
explore the world explore the vast avenues of knowledge that is in front
of us. It is absolutely in God’s service and what is expected of our
life.</p>
<h1 id="computer-and-ai-as-tools-for-synthesizing-wisdom">Computer and
AI as tools for synthesizing wisdom</h1>
<p>The amount of knowledge generated by the human race is increasing at
a rapid pace so much so that it is impossible to keep track of it let
alone find out new correlations and reveal new insights from the
existing knowledge to create wisdom. This is where data-chomping AI of
today comes into the picture.</p>
<p>AI and modern computations work on massive amounts of data to
synthesize new wisdom from existing knowledge base. We are at a point
where it is not possible for a single individual or even a team to
fathom and make use of the vast amount of knowledge we are generating.
AI works best with a large quantity of high quality data. As a result,
our journey to answering the last question would rest on creating and
making better and better AI tools as our companion until it becomes
powerful enough to make new and better versions of itself.</p>
<h1 id="preserving-your-knowledge-and-experience">Preserving your
knowledge and experience</h1>
<p>It is not only recommended but absolutely essential to write down and
preserve the experiences and knowledge we gain in our lifetime from our
unique life for the betterment of the next generation.</p>
<p>Preservation of knowledge is something that should be very important.
We should devise new ways of keeping the knowledge and experiences of
past individuals in an easily accessible form. Computers can help in
this regard as well. They should be developed further to store massive
amounts in an accessible way.</p>
<h1 id="computers-are-an-important-part-of-our-existence">Computers are
an important part of our existence</h1>
<p>We learn special languages to communicate effectively with computers.
We also spend a lot of time thinking and interacting with tools and
services enabled by computers. Computers are undeniably an important
part of our very existence. We should put in more and more effort into
computers as the last question will finally be answered by a
computer.</p>
<h1 id="humanity-as-a-whole-consisting-of-individuals">Humanity as a
whole consisting of individuals</h1>
<p>All this knowledge acquisition and preservation, developing and
training AI, etc should work at a planetary level with the individual
contribution of as many different experts as possible to bring together
the various life experiences and work with them.</p>
<h1 id="call-to-life-of-action">Call to life of action</h1>
<p>The last question will be answered. How and when cannot be said but
we <em>can</em> however decide if we play a small and important part in
the great journey of answering the last question. We owe this wonderful
universe our contribution by our individuality and life experiences. So
we are all special as we are doing our part. Now what part we are doing
rests on our own. So go ahead and lead the life you always wanted
to!</p>
